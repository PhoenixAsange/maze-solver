# Maze Solver
The maze is constrcuted from a text document, then it can be solved using:
* Depth First Search
* Iterative Deepening Depth First Search
* A*

# Disclaimer
This project was done as academic work for the Intelligent Systems course at Griffith University. The search algorithms are written by me, however the other components are not, such as the maze constructor or image generator.
